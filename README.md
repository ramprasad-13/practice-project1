# 🛠️ Project 1: "The Responsive Product Landing Page"

**Do not build a simple "About Me" page. Build a landing page for a fictional product (e.g., a high-end headphone).**

## Requirements':'

- **A sticky navigation bar** that stays at the top when scrolling.

- **A Hero section** with a centered call-to-action button.

- **A "Features" section** using CSS Grid to display cards.

- **A "Testimonials" section** using Flexbox.

## Strict Constraint':'

It must look perfect on Mobile (375px) and Desktop (1440px) using Media Queries.

## Interview Questions this answers':'

1. "Explain the difference between `display: none` and `visibility: hidden`."
2. "How do you center a div horizontally and vertically?" (You will do this 10 times in this project).
3. "What is the difference between rem, em, and px?"
